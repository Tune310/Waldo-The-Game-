WHAT TO DO ~~~~~~~~~~

KISS: KEEP IT SIMPLE DUMB ASS !!

1.When I click the play button I need it to - 

- put a random image in each div

-have waldo appear in only one random div
 
-make waldo = if clicked generate next game else = Game Over

I want jQuery to spit me a out a random div so I can insert an image in it when I click play


****** declare each pic as a variable with an img src

and make sure the pics array is linking with the variables

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

set up eventListeners if you click on the right box with waldo you get a point, else false
